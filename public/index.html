    <p> My name is Gideon Effiong. I am the type of person that likes to learn, unlearn and relearn new things. I am always curious about how things work that way and why it works that ways, and if it is good approach, I will try to improve on that particular phase and makes it much more better. And if reversed is the case, I will like to build it from scratch so that i can lay a good and solid foundation for that particular project  </p>
